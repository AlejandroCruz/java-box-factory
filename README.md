Java Console Application: Box Factory
=====================================

This repository includes files for a Java console application. The program displays data to the console in the form of coordinates for specified points. The points are used to build rectangles with points A, B, C, and D. Each corner of the rectangle is composed by the x/y pair coordinates that form each point.
